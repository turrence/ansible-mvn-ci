# ansible-mvn-ci

You are a DevOps engineer at XYZ Ltd. Your company is working on a Java application and wants to automate WAR file artifact deployment so that they don’t have to perform WAR deployment on Tomcat/Jetty web containers. Automate Ansible integration with Jenkins CI server so that we can run and execute playbooks to deploy custom WAR files to a web container and then perform restart for the web container.

 

Steps to Perform:

1. Configure Jenkins server as Ansible provisioning machine
2. Install Ansible plugins in Jenkins CI server
3.  Prepare Ansible playbook to run Maven build on Jenkins CI server
4.  Prepare Ansible playbook to execute deployment steps on the remote web container with restart of the web container post deployment
